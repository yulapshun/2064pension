== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After the plugin installation and settings adjustment on the settings page, it is still not working =

1. You should click "Save Changes". Make sure that you got the message "Settings saved".
2. Refresh your web page where Facebook Button icon should be placed.

= How to change Facebook Button icon ("Profile URL")? =

1. In WordPress admin panel, please go to Facebook Button settings page and choose one of the listed positions: Default Profile Button Image or Custom Profile Button Image. Then click "Save Changes".
2. If you choose Custom Profile Button Image, you can upload your own picture. You should click "Choose file" and choose an image in your folder. Then click "Save Changes".

= How to set Facebook Button position on the page? =

In WordPress admin panel, please go to Facebook Button settings page and choose one of the listed positions: Before content or After content. Then click "Save Changes".

= After clicking Facebook Button icon, I see the Facebook Home page instead of the necessary account page =

1. In WordPress admin panel, please go to Facebook Button settings page and enter your Facebook ID or username. Then click "Save Changes".
2. If you do not have the Facebook account yet, you should create it here. After the account is created, please follow the instructions above.

= When people like and/or leave comments to my post, will this be displayed on my Facebook page? =

No, it will not. The case is: Like for a WordPress site is a Like of a certain URL, but not the page content, while on Facebook it's Like of the content, not the URL. I.e. these are two different things, and it is impossible to link them.
For more data on the Like button, please check the developers' page (<https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button>).

= If I install a new version of the plugin, will I lose all the likes I got on the previous version (I mean will they switch to zero on my website?)? =

You will not lose them because they are stored on the Facebook server.

= I have some problems with the plugin's work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support? =

Please make sure that the problem hasn't been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem's description:
- The link to the page where the problem occurs
- The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version - your order number.
- The version of your WordPress installation
- Copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wi2X8RdRGXk9kMszQy1xItJrpN0ncXgioH935MaBKtc/)
